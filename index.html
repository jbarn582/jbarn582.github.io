	<p>I am a Sports Management junior at http://www.bju.edu/ who lives in Lynchburg, Virginia. I play basketball for the http://www.bjubruins.com/ and have done this for the past year here. My goal is to play basketball overseas and then coach, teach, and do camps. I also want to be able to train athletes and show them the Gospel through the sports that they play. I try to use my platform to help others see who Jesus really is and what He ca do for them. I want to be able to help younger Christians be a light in their community no matter what they do.</p>
