	<p>I am a Sports Management junior at <a href="Bob Jones University"> who lives in Lynchburg, Virginia. I play basketball for the <a href="BJU Bruins"> and have done this for the past year here. My goal is to play basketball overseas and then coach, teach, and do camps. I also want to be able to train athletes and show them the Gospel through the sports that they play. I try to use my platform to help others see who Jesus really is and what He ca do for them. I want to be able to help younger Christians be a light in their community no matter what they do.</p>
<p>My other interests besides basketball are road trips during the summer, eating at Mexican restaurants, and going to new places. I also enjoy developing relationships with people in the community as well as in the sports world. I like spending quality time with my family and friends. I really enjoy watching sports, whether it is on TV or live, there is nothing like a good game that wrecks your nerves sometimes. I also really enjoy my brothers in my society and being around them.</p>
